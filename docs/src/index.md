# Spglib

Documentation for [Spglib](https://github.com/singularitti/Spglib.jl).

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions
and types.

The code, which is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/singularitti/Spglib.jl), is tested
using various continuous integration services for its validity.

This repository is created and maintained by
[@singularitti](https://github.com/singularitti), and contributions are highly welcome.

## Package features

`Spglib.jl` is a Julia wrapper of the C library [Spglib](https://github.com/spglib/spglib).
See [this page](https://spglib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/interface.html#julia-interface).
It is used for finding and handling crystal symmetries.

There was a package [`LibSymspg.jl`](https://juliahub.com/ui/Packages/LibSymspg/D1i7g)
thanks to [@unkcpz](https://github.com/unkcpz).
However, it is no longer actively maintained.

This package:

- enables the finding and handling of crystal symmetries;
- includes new naming conventions, input types, and return types of functions.

## Installation

The package can be installed with the Julia package manager.
From [the Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/), type `]` to enter
the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) and run:

```julia-repl
pkg> add Spglib
```

Or, equivalently, via [`Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/):

```@repl
import Pkg; Pkg.add("Spglib")
```

Windows.
